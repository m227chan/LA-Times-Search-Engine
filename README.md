# üì∞üîç LA Times Search Engine Project

## üí° Summary:<br>
The project involves the development of a search engine implemented through multiple Java programs.  The IndexEngine program processes and indexes a collection of documents from the LA Times document collection, totaling ~131,000 documents. It extracts key information and constructs an inverted index, offering optional stemming during the tokenization process. The resulting structured directory stores compressed documents, lexicon files, and an inverted index file. The InteractiveBM25 program utilizes the BM25 ranking algorithm to score and retrieve documents based on user queries, providing an interactive and dynamic search experience. The BM25 program implements the BM25 algorithm for information retrieval, taking command-line arguments and producing results in TREC format. Lastly, the ReportPerTopicEvalScore program evaluates the system's performance, calculating key metrics like Average Precision and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain. Together, these programs create a comprehensive search engine with indexing, retrieval, ranking, and evaluation capabilities.

## üßÆ IndexEngine:<br>
This Index Engine Java Program serves as an information retrieval system for processing and indexing a collection of documents. It takes as input a gzip-compressed data file containing documents with specific tags such as DOCNO, HEADLINE, TEXT, and GRAPHIC. The program extracts relevant information from these tags, including document numbers, dates, headlines, and textual content. It tokenizes and processes the text, performing optional stemming, and then constructs an inverted index to map terms to document IDs and their corresponding word frequencies. The program generates metadata for each document, compresses the documents, and stores them in a structured directory based on their publication dates. Additionally, it creates lexicon files and an inverted index file to facilitate efficient retrieval of information. The user can specify whether or not to apply stemming during the tokenization process.<br>
  
## üîÑ InteractiveBM25:<br>
The InteractiveBM25 Java Program, is an information retrieval system that utilizes the BM25 ranking algorithm to score and retrieve documents based on user-inputted queries. The program takes as input a path to a Gzip'd data file containing indexed documents and associated metadata. It employs tokenization, regular expressions, and various calculations to process the user's query, ranking the matching documents according to BM25 scores. The program then presents the top retrieval results, displaying relevant metadata such as headlines, dates, and document snippets. Users can interactively choose to view the full content of a specific document or enter new queries. The implementation includes file reading, data manipulation, and user interface components to facilitate a dynamic and informative search experience.<br>

## üîç BM25:<br>
The BM25 Java Program, serves as an implementation for the BM25 ranking algorithm, a popular information retrieval method. The program takes four command-line arguments: the path to a compressed data file, the path to a queries file, the path to store the results, and a flag (0 or 1) indicating whether to apply Porter Stemming to the index. It uses tokenization, reads serialized objects representing the index and lexicon, and computes BM25 scores for each document based on the provided queries. The results, containing topic IDs, document ranks, scores, and other relevant information, are then written to an output file in TREC format. The code is structured with error-checking for file paths and arguments.<br>

## üìä ReportPerTopicEvalScore:<br>
The ReportPerTopicEvalScore Java program serves as an evaluator for information retrieval systems. It takes two command line arguments‚Äî the path to a search engine's results file and a file containing relevance judgments (qrels). The program calculates three key evaluation metrics for each query: Average Precision (AP), Precision at Rank 10 (P_10), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). The results are then written to an output file named "output.txt."<br>
